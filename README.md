I have added an authenticate module with the following APIâ€™s

- Login

The router maps /login to this api and the username and password is parsed from the query string (may want to change that?) and reruns a jwt token in a cookie. It is set as a cookie rather than a bearer token in the header because it is very difficult to intercept href calls client side. However, cookies are automatically transmitted hence the decision to go with that mechanism.

- Authenticate

The router can use this API to authenticate access to restricted resources. For now, I have set this to anything in the new user directory I have created. I have moved the betting page into this directory which means you now need to be logged in to see that page. If you are not authenticated it redirects the client to the login screen.

\*\* Client-side changes

I have added a basic login screen and some client-side java script to call the server login API when you click the login button. It then redirects you to the index page. The session currently only lives for 30 seconds before it expires this is just to allow us to easily see and test that expiry logic for now.

\*\*\*\* The username and password for logging in is bob and pass. This is currently hardcoded and needs to come from a database instead. I wanted to keep it really simple for now and once everyone understands someone else can maybe use the controller to grab and validate the user properly.

\*\* Controller module started

I have started a controller module that encapsulates all the database code and has a couple of APIs for getting users. This under the hood is just using the films database example for the labs and needs changing for our own collection of users but its just to show how it can be done. Again, maybe someone else can enhance implement this further?

I have exposed the getUsers API as a REST end point at /api/users so you can test through a web page.

Changes to authenticate module - removed redirect login from module so it could be used for the rest api without a ridirect happening. The router now handles wat to do with unauthenticated requestes as they should be different between web pages and rest apis

Added stub functions for registering new users into the controller router and added client side form to invoke the rest api.

Navigation bar has been added with additional pages, which are now all interlinked. Partials have been added which will replace the html files in due course. The work is merged with the previous commit, integrating all the work together.

Teams, Games and Matches added to the database. You can now pull the data from the database in the form of a json file. Data of the collections have been added in the file structure as json data.

Need to create default data for the database using the 2 json files, follow the instructions that was covered in the seminar for this specific topic.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Database updated with placeholders for the teams that is indexed inside the arrays of the Game collection. Partial has been created for matches which now show placeholders for fixtures to be present. Mike is going to work on how to fill these placeholders in with the teams and their information.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

09-Oct-2019 Mike Knight

Code to create full model by replacing team id in the matches array with the team objects. This is so the names and image paths can be used in rendering the view of the current game to bet on.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enhanced matches partial view to look more like the template Gemma created. Dropped the matches down to one per row to make it more mobile friendly. Added a buttom to the bottom that will require an click handler for grabbing all the prediction values and submits them to the server.

Have done a big tidy up of the project. All undeeded HTML files have been removed to reduce chance of confusion as I noticed 2 copies of bettingPage was already in there. We dont want a repeat of the routes issue hey Sully ;-)

I have done a bit of a tidy up of the nav bar and converted the landing page to an ejs file. Some of the links have also been updated too. For now the landing page shows you this weeks bets. Thought that was a nice idea?

The nav bar can now detect if a user is logged in and shows either login\register or logout.

Only remaining .html pages are login and register which will be converted to ejs shortly.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transferred some css formatting to the main.css page, hopefully to fix the spinbox issues. However this formatting has caused the matches to flex weirdly on the page, so we will still need to work on that.

Converted register.html page to ejs and deleted old register.html page, have added a route to router.js so that the register page can now be accessed from main index page

Should also now be able to see the javascript on controller.js and client.js that allows us to save newly registered users to our user database on Mongo

Edit/update: also reformatted the matches ejs so that the matches don't overlap, and changed the client.js redirect from "index.html" to "/" so that it goes back to the main index page

To do: I have begun creating a login.ejs which I will update in due course. I will then delete login.html

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Merged Gemmas changes into the main code. Fixed a couple of issues caused by the merge and did yet another tidy!

Moved the login API to api\login in case Gemma wants to map the login ejs to the \login route.

Finished off authentication so it now will authenticate the provided details against the databse.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

16-Oct-2019 Gemma

Created a login ejs which now links to the main index page so that when the login button is clicked on, it will direct to the login ejs. The nav bar will also still display the logged out version until someone has logged in.

Anywhere linked to login.html has now had it replaced by "/login" for login.ejs

Apologies, my Prettier add-on has insisted on formatting everything on separate lines, so you might want to re-format if it makes it easy to read.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

17-Oct-2019 Gemma

Added error function: when you click submit on the register page, if the username field is blank then "username cannot be blank" will appear just above submit button.

I'm trying to make the error message a red colour, but .error {color: red} isn't working in the main.css stylesheet, which makes me think that the bootstrap styling might be overriding it for some reason.

Also linked the main index page to the Super6 button on the nav bar to make it easier to navigate back to the home page.

Also tidied up the html of the matches on the main.ejs page so that they're not all over the place! Team logos and names are still hard-coded for now, but can be changed in due course

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

18-Oct-2019 Mike Knight

Merge of Gemmas work from branch to master. There was a little bug where the client side js was not being included with ejs which i have fixed by including in in head.ejs

edit\* moved users.json, removed betting page and made main page render matches from databse

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

21-Oct-2019 Gemma

Reformatted the error messages on register.ejs

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

21-Oct-2019 Mike Knight

Added a game module with a timer that will fire when the matches are set to start. This will invoke the main game logic of the website.

Fixed a small bug where clicking the home page went to the wrong route.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

21-Oct-2019 Sully

Added a updated_user.json with a example model for user predictions and results.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

21-Oct-2019 Mike Knight

Made some changes to authentication, added a logout API and hooked it up to the nav bar. The API basically clears the access_token cookie.

Moved the JWT secret to an env vairable, it should ideally go in env.secret but its fine for this protoype and makes it available system wide.

General tidy up of the authenticate module.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

22-Oct-2019 Gemma

Register page now displays error message if fields are left blank, but customer information remains in any fields that have already been filled in

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

24-Oct-2019 Gemma

game.js has been set up by Michael and I'm trying to add some game logic that allows a random score to be generated in multiples of 10 (as per quidditch rules), and the score should be weighted by the skill level of the team (skill level between 0 and 1), so that multiplying the score by the skill level gives an overall weighted score, which can then be returned to the results page.

I've also added a Golden Snitch section to the betting/matches page as that it something we wanted to add.

Some of the team logos have had their background removed/turned transparent just in case we want a coloured background

Tweaked some of the css but still can't get the divs to align properly on betting/matches page

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

24-Oct-2019 Mike Knight

Added a new getUsername API in the authenticate module. This extracts the username string from the encrypted JTW token and returns it.

If the returned string is null it means the user is not logged in. If you get a valid string you can assume the user is authenticated.
